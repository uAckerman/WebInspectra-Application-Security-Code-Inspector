# Codexaegis-Application-Security-Code-Inspector
I built Codexaegis, a developer-focused security inspection framework designed to analyze running web applications for vulnerabilities using automated attack simulation and modular security checks, with an architecture ready for future IDE integration.

# Feature
- Inspect application functions for vulnerabilities
- Automated attack simulation against running endpoints
- Detect webapp threats and logic flaws
- Modular security check system
- Vulnerable and secure demo applications
- IDE integration ready architecture

# Workflow

## Phase 1: Build the app ( [app.py](https://github.com/uAckerman/Codexaegis-Application-Security-Code-Inspector/blob/main/app.py) )

I built a simple Flask based web application to demonstrate how authentication systems work and how common security vulnerabilities can occur if secure coding practices are not followed.

The application uses **Flask** as the backend framework and **SQLite** as the database. When the app runs for the first time, it automatically initializes a database file (**database.db**) and creates a users table with fields for id, username, and password. It also inserts a default user (**admin / admin123**) for testing purposes.
